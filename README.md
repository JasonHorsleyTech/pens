# Pens
Short snippets, to nail down an effect or help coworkers through a roadblock

## Structure
Each idea, or pen, is in it's own seperate self contained folder. And I'm going to stick with mostly inline stuff, since this is never meant to be anything more than simple ideas.

Yes codepen exists, but I can't upload assets or showoff on github.
